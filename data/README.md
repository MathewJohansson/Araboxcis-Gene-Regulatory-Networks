# Data Directory

This directory contains the input data files required to run the analysis. Due to file size constraints, large data files are not included in this repository.

## Required Files

### Included in Repository

- **`clusterLabels.txt`** - Cell type annotations for the 12 flower clusters
- **`gboxNetwork22C.csv`** - Reference AraBOXcis network from bulk RNA-seq (Ezer et al. 2017)

### Not Included (Download Required)

The following large data files must be downloaded separately:

1. **`flowerdata.RData`** (~50+ MB)
   - Contains: `gbox` (gene expression matrix) and `clust` (cluster assignments)
   - Source: Derived from GEO dataset GSE226097
   - Required for: All analyses

2. **`functionalData.RData`** 
   - Contains: `GOconcat` (Gene Ontology annotations) and `goOfInterest` (GO terms of interest)
   - Required for: GO enrichment analysis (Section 26 of analysis script)

## How to Obtain Missing Data

**Option 1:** Download from the original source
- Visit: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE226097
- Download the single-cell RNA-seq data for *Arabidopsis* flowers
- Process according to the methods in the associated publication

**Option 2:** Contact the repository author
- Email: [your email if you want to share it]
- The processed `.RData` files can be shared directly

## Data Files Generated by Analysis

The analysis script will create additional files in `results/`:
- `results/tables/` - Output tables (avg expression, TF-target pairs, centrality metrics)
- `results/networks/` - Inferred GENIE3 network
- `results/figures/` - Visualisations

These are automatically generated when running `flower_gene_network_analysis.R`.
